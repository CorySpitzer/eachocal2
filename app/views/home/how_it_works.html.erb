              Research shows that both EISR and constant intervals are better than massed study (Dung, 2013). There are conflicting results on how EISR and constant intervals compare, which might mean that either might be good in different situations. Kang argues EISR is better in the short term and they are about as effective as each other over the long term (2014). However, EISR is more scalable because you have to practice less over time. That said, we're not aware of research over periods greater than 3 months.

            <h5 class="card-title mt-4">Summary of (Kang, 2014) from the Claude LLM</h5>
            <div class="summary-section">
              <p class="card-text">
                The key research question was: Is it better to space review sessions at expanding intervals or equal intervals when learning material over time? While earlier research by Landauer and Bjork (1978) supported expanding intervals, more recent studies had questioned this conclusion.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The researchers identified two key limitations of previous studies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most studies confined training to a single session</li>
                <li>They focused only on final test performance rather than maintaining knowledge throughout the learning period</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="card-text">
                To address these limitations, they conducted a 28-day experiment studying Japanese-English vocabulary pairs with 37 participants:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Expanding condition: Practice on Days 1, 3, 9, and 28</li>
                <li>Equal-interval condition: Practice on Days 1, 10, 19, and 28</li>
                <li>Final test given 56 days after training (Day 84)</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="card-title mt-4">Key Findings</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Final test performance was similar between conditions (expanding: 49% vs equal-interval: 46%)</li>
                <li>The expanding condition showed significantly less forgetting between end of training and final test</li>
                <li>Most importantly, the expanding schedule maintained higher average recall throughout the training period (51% vs 43%)</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="card-title mt-4">Conclusions</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                The researchers conclude that when practice is spread over days or weeks:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Expanding schedules produce better continuous access to the material during training</li>
                <li>They achieve this without compromising long-term retention</li>
                <li>This makes expanding schedules potentially more valuable for real-world learning situations where maintaining access to information throughout training is important</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="card-text mt-4">
                This research suggests that for long-term learning scenarios (like language learning or job training), expanding practice schedules may be more effective than equal-interval practice, particularly when considering the need to maintain access to the information throughout the learning period.

              <p class="mb-0">"It is well established in the memory literature that reviews spaced apart in time enhance long-term retention of material more than do reviews that occur soon after initial study (the spacing effect; see Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006, for a survey), and that reviews are more effective when they involve testing instead of re-presentation (also known as retrieval practice; e.g., Carrier & Pashler, 1992; Kang, McDermott, & Roediger, 2007; see Roediger & Karpicke, 2006, for a review). Spacing and testing can be combined—that is, spaced retrieval practice—in order to obtain the benefits of both."</p>

              <p class="mb-0">"For the learning of foreign vocabulary spread over four weeks, we found that expanding retrieval practice (i.e., sessions separated by increasing numbers of days) produced recall equivalent to that from equal-interval practice on a final test given eight weeks after training. However, the expanding schedule yielded much higher average recallability over the whole training period."</p>

              <p class="mb-0">"On a final test given shortly after practice, an expanding schedule of practice yielded the highest recall (followed by equal-interval, contracting, and massed practice, respectively).

              <p class="mb-0">"when retrieval practice is spread out over days or weeks, scheduling the review sessions in an expanding fashion produces better average performance than does equal-interval spacing over the training period.
